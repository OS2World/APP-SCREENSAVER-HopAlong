Hopalong release 1.0

This is my first module designed for the OS/2 screen saver "ScreenSaver" by Siegfried Hanisch.  This have been tested under version 1.1 only.

Use:
Copy a Cset /2 DDE4MBS.DLL in a directory on your libpath and copy hopalong.ssm 
in the directory of Screen Saver 1.1 .

This module works fine on my system  ( 486 Dx 33 Mhz 8 Mb ram and TVGA8900C ).

You may feel free to distribute this wherever you want, and if you can
earn money off of them, by all means do, as long as the .ssm module are
in no way altered, and this "readme" file accompanies the .ssm module
wherever they go.
